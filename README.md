# Colorize a grayscale image using colored lines
The main goal of the project is to build a desktop application to color a grayscale image using the user, where the user places some colored lines on some areas of the image so that these lines are used to color the image:
The project will be built based on the soble edge  detection algorithm for edge extraction and the flood fill  algorithm for coloring.
